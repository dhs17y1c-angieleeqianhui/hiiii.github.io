    <h2>Synopsis</h2>
    <img src="Capture02.JPG">
    <p>The film is a heartwarming comedy and family melodrama about a mentally challenged man wrongfully imprisoned for murder, who builds friendships with the hardened criminals in his cell, and in return they help him see his daughter again by smuggling her into the prison.Lee Yong-go is a mentally impaired father with the intellect of a six-year-old, who lives in a run-down house along with his daughter Ye-seung. One day, he gets into a physical altercation with the police commissioner, who has just purchased the last Sailor Moon backpack for his daughter, a gift Yong-go was saving up to buy for Ye-seung. Soon after, the police commissioner's daughter dies in a freak accident, in which she slips on ice and suffers a fatal blow to the back of her head while she is taking Yong-go to another store that sells the same backpack. When he tries to resuscitate her, a woman witnesses him and mistakes him to be molesting her. Yong-go is falsely accused of the abduction, murder, and rape of a minor. The police quickly took advantage of his disability and forced him to admit to the crimes, while ignoring exonerating evidence. Yong-go, who is sentenced to death, is imprisoned and assigned to Cell No. 7, the harshest cell in a maximum security prison.
At first, the other men in the cell, led by gang leader So Yang-ho, do not take kindly to Yong-go after reading in his file that he murdered and molested a child. However, when Yong-go saves Yang-ho from being fatally stabbed by a rival gang leader, Yang-ho repays the favor by smuggling Ye-seung into Cell No. 7. Over time, they come to believe in his innocence, and make it their goal to help reverse the verdict at Yong-go's retrial.</p>

    <h2>Review</h2>
    <p>Although being classified as a heartwarming comedy and family melodrama, the movie is more than heartwarming. There are parts that broke the audience’s heart and made them cry, there are parts that were hilarious and made the audience laugh badly, there were parts that made the audience felt nervous. All of the scenes were well filmed and were able to make the audience feels that they are at the place. The way the movies was filmed showcased how Yong-Gu was accused and couldn’t reverse the verdict during the retrials as he was threatened by the police force to admit that he was a murderer because the girl he tried to save was the daughter of the chief of the National Police Agency. It was heartbreaking during the part near the ending of the movie when Ye-Seung cried and yelled to  the officers to not bring her father to receive his penalty. It also showcased how Yong-Gu was mentally implied but still love his daughter so much and was willing to protect her even with his own death. The very first and last scene showed how his daughter tried to reverse the verdict after she grew up but it appears to be a test for her to become a lawyer. </p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This movie is heartwarming and sad at the same time. Even though it's a low cost production, it showcased a lot of things that high cost production movies might not even showcase. If given the chance, I would like to watch this movie again. I definitely look forward to more movies like this.</p>
